# NSCAP

## HW2
simulating ping from different devices, how the ARP table on the host and the MAC table on the switch change

+ The ARP table will map the destination IP to the destination MAC address.
+ The MAC table records which port to forward packets to for a particular destination host.

## HW3
calculate 'success_rate, idle_rate, collision_rate' when using different Medium Access Control protocol

Observing various MAC protocol parameters such as 'success_rate, idle_rate, collision_rate,' how do they change with factors such as increasing packet count, packet length, number of devices, etc.
