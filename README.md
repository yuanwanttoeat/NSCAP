## HW2
simulating ping from different devices, how the ARP table on the host and the MAC table on the switch change

+ The ARP table will map the destination IP to the destination MAC address.
+ The MAC table records which port to forward packets to for a particular destination host.

## HW3
calculate 'success_rate, idle_rate, collision_rate' when using different Medium Access Control protocol

Observing the 'success_rate, idle_rate, collision_rate' of various MAC protocols, what changes can be expected as factors such as the number of packets per unit increases, the packet length increases, the number of devices increases, etc.
